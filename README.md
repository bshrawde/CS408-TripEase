####Problem Statement
Trips are fun, till you get confused about where to stay, what to eat and what to do. Why not have an interactive web-browser do it for you? We can help you find the best restaurants to tingle your palette, and comfortable hotels to relax in along with popular activities nearby, depending on what city you choose to go for that perfect trip.

####Project Objectives
Our program will run as a web based application which a customer can use to plan all future trips and will allow the user to select the place he wants to visit and also allocate the budget for the trip. Based on these inputs the application will come up with the top rated restaurants/hotels in that area and also show a list of all fun activities which can be performed in/near that area. Our application will also have one special feature, where it will load a set of restaurants specific to the dietary requirements set by the user. Also, the application will group together solo travellers who want to travel as a group according to their needs and interests.
